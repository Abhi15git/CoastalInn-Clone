          Thank you for choosing Coastal Inn at Beulah! We have been working hard to make our property into a special place that we know you’ll love, and hope you’ll want to return to year after year.
<br /><br />
***IMPORTANT NOTE***
PLEASE ensure that the number of people in your party does NOT exceed the maximum occupancy for each unit. In compliance with Michigan law and in order to maintain our insurance, we are unable to be flexible with this policy, even if you have already arrived on-site.
<br /><br />
ARRIVAL TIMES: We will be in the front office to receive you between 4:00 PM -6:00, late arrival check-in is from 6:00- 9:00 PM (you will receive a pre-arrival email a few days before your stay about late arrival instructions) Arrivals after 9:00pm MUST be arranged in advance, by calling 231-383-4116 or email (Cari@coastalsuitesresort.com)<br />
CANCELLATIONS: Reservations of 2 nights or less may be cancelled without penalty 72 hours prior to the arrival date, except during July and August where we will require 7 days advance notice. Reservations of more than 2 nights must be cancelled 7 days prior to arrival, except during July and August where we require 14 days advance notice. Any cancellation after this period may be subject to the full booking price. Should you find it necessary to depart earlier than your confirmed reservation dates, you will be responsible for all of the original room nights booked for your stay. There are no refunds for early departure. ***EMERGENCY CANCELLATIONS*** We understand that sometimes medical/family/work emergencies come up that make a last minute cancellation necessary. We will do our best to work with you, but please understand that a full refund is usually not possible, because we are a small business that operates on smaller margins. If we are able to re-book your cancelled room, we may be able to refund you, but otherwise our cancellation policy must remain in effect. For this reason we strongly recommend travel insurance if this is a concern for you.<br />

FRONT DESK HOURS: Due to our small size, we keep limited front desk hours. We will be available for checkouts from 9-11am, and from 4-6pm, if you will be checking out before 9, please arrange this with the front desk at check-in.<br />
BREAKFAST: We offer a continental-style breakfast for all guests each morning, more details about this will be found in your pre-arrival email.<br />
